/// Three timestamps describing a piece of data's lifecycle across a communication chain.
///
/// This exists for data that travels through a chain of producers and consumers — most
/// commonly **API / websocket communication**, where there are clear boundaries between
/// the moment an event *happens*, the moment a part of the chain *becomes aware* of it,
/// and the moment a part of the chain *finishes assembling* it. When you have those
/// boundaries, collapsing them into a single timestamp throws away the very information
/// you need to reason about latency and ordering, so implement this trait instead.
///
/// - `ts_event`: when the upstream authority (e.g. the exchange) says the event happened.
///   This is *their* clock, not ours.
/// - `ts_init`: when *we* first became aware of the data — the reception time of the very
///   first contributing message. For a single-message element this is just "when it
///   arrived"; for a batched/merged container it is when the first constituent arrived.
/// - `ts_last`: when *we* last wrote into the container — the reception time of the very
///   last contributing message. Equals `ts_init` for trivial single-event containers, and
///   diverges for anything we accumulate over multiple messages (order-book diffs, trade
///   batches, merged snapshots).
///
/// ## When to implement
/// - Wire types decoded from an exchange REST/websocket payload, where the payload carries
///   an event time but you also want to pin reception time.
/// - Containers you build up incrementally from a stream (a book you fold diffs into, a
///   trade batch you flush periodically): `ts_init`/`ts_last` then bracket the window of
///   reception, while `ts_event` tracks the upstream-reported time of the latest fold.
///
/// ## When NOT to implement
/// - Data that never crosses a communication boundary, where "event time" and "reception
///   time" are the same instant — there is nothing for the three fields to disambiguate.
///
/// All three are required: they are semantically distinct, and a default that silently
/// substituted one for another would mask real bugs (network latency, missed batch-merge
/// bookkeeping). If the three would genuinely coincide, that is a signal the data does not
/// belong on this trait.
